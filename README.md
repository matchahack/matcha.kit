> By the end of this guide, you will be doing `embedded systems signal generation and manipulation on bare metal`

> Note that although `this whole kit is open source`, you can also [buy it in one go here](https://matchahack.bigcartel.com/product/matcha-kit) for your convenience (or if you want to help the project grow!)

## RUN THE TUTORIALS

There is a `README.md` to follow in each of the tutorials. You can follow in order! Or not! Up to you.

In each subdirectory, there is a `Makefile` which builds the hardware design and loads the resulting binary onto the FPGA. They have all been tested, and do work.

> Once you have completed tutorial `1_blink`...Good job. You are now a **_bare-metal programmer_**. Good luck out there, and feel free to drop by the [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1320785628333346836/1321062900311396362) if you have questions!
