> Loading a bitstream to the tang will make the `lights turn on`!

To use this program, you need to install the toolchain outlined in the `README.md` in the `tutorial 0`.

You also need to make sure the FPGA is connected correctly!

After this is done successfully, you should be able to run the following from your `wsl-2` terminal:

```
make load
```
